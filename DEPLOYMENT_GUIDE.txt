🚀 HUGGING FACE SPACES DEPLOYMENT GUIDE
==========================================

Your Samarth AI project is now ready for deployment to Hugging Face Spaces!

✅ COMPLETED STEPS:
-------------------
1. ✓ Created Gradio version of your app (app.py)
2. ✓ Updated README.md with HuggingFace Spaces metadata
3. ✓ Added Gradio to requirements.txt
4. ✓ Created .gitignore file
5. ✓ Committed all changes to git
6. ✓ Added HuggingFace remote repository


📋 NEXT STEPS TO DEPLOY:
------------------------

STEP 1: Install Hugging Face CLI (if not already installed)
   Run in PowerShell:
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://hf.co/cli/install.ps1 | iex"

STEP 2: Login to Hugging Face
   huggingface-cli login
   (You'll need your HuggingFace access token from https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)

STEP 3: Push to Hugging Face Space
   cd "f:\Bharat Fellowship\samarth"
   git push huggingface main

   OR if you need to allow unrelated histories:
   git pull huggingface main --allow-unrelated-histories
   git push huggingface main --force


⚠️ IMPORTANT - SECURITY NOTES:
------------------------------
1. Your config.yaml contains API keys. Hugging Face Spaces needs these!
   
   Option A (Recommended): Use Hugging Face Secrets
   - Go to your Space settings: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Premkumar0709/krishisutra-ai-powered-agricultural-intelligence/settings
   - Add these secrets:
     * GOOGLE_API_KEY = AIzaSyCdSM2oDPOOe3YfcmFPQY6R3dccjY7Ah2c
     * DATA_GOV_API_KEY = 579b464db66ec23bdd000001cdd3946e44ce4aad7209ff7b23ac571b
   
   Then modify app.py to read from environment variables:
   
   Option B: Keep config.yaml (Less secure but simpler)
   - Current config.yaml will be uploaded with your keys
   - This is acceptable for public/free APIs, but not recommended for production


📁 DATA FILES:
--------------
Make sure you have these data files in your 'data/' folder:
- Mean_Temp_IMD_2017.csv
- Current Daily Price of Various Commodities from Various Markets (Mandi).csv
- GetPMKisanDatagov.json

These will be uploaded to HuggingFace with your Space.


🔧 TESTING LOCALLY:
-------------------
Before deploying, test your Gradio app locally:
   python app.py

Then visit: http://localhost:7860


📊 AFTER DEPLOYMENT:
--------------------
Your Space will be available at:
https://huggingface.co/spaces/Premkumar0709/krishisutra-ai-powered-agricultural-intelligence

It may take a few minutes to build and start.


🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING:
-------------------
If deployment fails:
1. Check the build logs in your HuggingFace Space
2. Verify all data files are present
3. Check that requirements.txt has all dependencies
4. Ensure API keys are properly configured


💡 OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS:
-------------------------
1. Add a custom thumbnail image
2. Update Space description and tags
3. Enable Discussions for user feedback
4. Set up Space analytics
