   c. Make sure it has "write" access
   d. Copy the token (starts with "hf_...")

STEP 2: Login to Hugging Face
   Option A - Using HF CLI (Recommended):
      First install the CLI:
      powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://hf.co/cli/install.ps1 | iex"

STEP 3: Push to Hugging Face Space
   cd "f:\Bharat Fellowship\samarth"
   
   Method 1 - Direct push (if logged in via CLI):
   git push huggingface main
   
   Method 2 - With credentials in URL:
   git remote remove huggingface
   git remote add huggingface https://Premkumar0709:<YOUR_HF_TOKEN>@huggingface.co/spaces/Premkumar0709/krishisutra-ai-powered-agricultural-intelligence
   git push huggingface main
   
   If you get "unrelated histories" error:
   git pull huggingface main --allow-unrelated-histories
   git push huggingface main


‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT - CONFIGURE API KEYS IN HUGGINGFACE:
--------------------------------------------------
Your config.yaml contains API keys that will be uploaded to HuggingFace.

1. Go to: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Premkumar0709/krishisutra-ai-powered-agricultural-intelligence/settings
2. Scroll to "Repository secrets"
3. Add these secrets:
   Name: GOOGLE_API_KEY
   Value: AIzaSyCdSM2oDPOOe3YfcmFPQY6R3dccjY7Ah2c
   
   Name: DATA_GOV_API_KEY
   Value: 579b464db66ec23bdd000001cdd3946e44ce4aad7209ff7b23ac571b
